##### Reps of a finite group over a complex vector space.

* Precise def: group hom $\rho : G \to GL(V)$. The **degree** is $\dim{V}$.
* Imagine a collection of linear maps on a f.d. complex vector space with a group structure.
    * Requires intuition for linear maps on f.d. vector space; finite groups
* A functor from $G$ considered as a category (with a single object) to the category **Vect** of complex vector spaces.
* Examples
    * $C_n$: a matrix of order $n$, and its powers.
    * $D_6$: matrices corresponding to rotations and reflections in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
    * $\mathbb{C}X$: permutation matrices corresponding to a G-action on $X$, for any group $G$.
