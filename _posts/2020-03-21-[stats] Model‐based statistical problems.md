I've assembled a collection of statistical problems that I hope are amenable to a model-based approach (specify a model, and then perform inference on the parameters). For each category of problems I've given a brief summary followed by specific examples. The long-term aim is to establish some principles as to when it's feasible to black-box a problem as "feasible with a model-based approach", and some guiding principles for model selection. No attempt made at keeping the categories distinct or similar-sized.

### Fitting a simple distribution

Determining the distribution that describes observed data. (This could refer to a lot of different problems). In particular, what sort of processes give rise to what sort of distribution? Expect this problem to be an important sub-problem when building models for bigger stuff.

* Human height, weight etc (common wisdom is Gaussian, but is this true?)
* Reported orgasm intensity, reported mood, reported dream duration etc
* Word length etc

### Relevance inference

Determining the relevance of variables as predictors of other variables.

* Which genes are predictors of certain diseases?
* What human attributes are predictors of future behaviour: eg crime, academic/financial success?

### Factor inference

Separating a variable into independently varying factors. Unearthing the factors or properties that underpin observed data.

* What are the axes on which personality varies? Other psychometrics, including intelligence.
* The cocktail party problem, decoding neural spike trains, and other superposition problems.
* What are the attributes on which people evaluate a potential partner, a political candidate, or a brand?

### Survival inference

Understanding distribution of times before the occurrence of some event.

* Lifetime of cancer patients.
* Time before addiction relapse, criminal recidivism

### Percolation

Spread of variables

### Causal inference

Determining causal links between variables. (An extension of relevance). Probably involv

* How does nutrition affect health?
* 

### Clustering (general)

### Classification (general)

### Regression (general)
