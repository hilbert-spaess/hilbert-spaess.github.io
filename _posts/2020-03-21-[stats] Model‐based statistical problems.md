Here is a collection of statistical problems that I hope are amenable to a model-based approach (specify a model, and then perform inference on the parameters). For each category of problems I've given a brief summary followed by specific examples. 

### Relevance inference

### Causal inference

### Factor inference

### Survival inference

### Relevance inference

### Clustering (general)

### Classification (general)

### Regression (general)
