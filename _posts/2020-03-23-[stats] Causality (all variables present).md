This is a summary of the start of Pearl's "Causality". Specifically, it covers the inference of causal relations in the absence of hidden variables.

## Bayesian networks and conditional independence 

Two variables $x$ and $y$ are independent if $P(x \vert y) = P(x)$, so that the value of $y$ tells us nothing about $x$, and vice versa. A generalisation of this concept is the notion of **conditional independence**. Given a finite set of variables $V$, and three subsets $X, Y, Z \subset V$, we say that $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent, given $Z$, if $P(X \vert Y, Z) = P(X, Z)$. We write this as $$(X \perp Y \vert Z)$$. An intuition to have here is that Z "screens off" $X$ from $Y$.

A Bayesian network is a suggestive shorthand for a joint probability density. If there is a hierarchy of dependencies among the variables involved, then the joint density can be written as a product of conditional densities. If we have a beta prior
