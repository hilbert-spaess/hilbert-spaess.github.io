Simpson's paradox is a phenomenon in which a correlation 'reverses' once a new confounding variable is taken into account. It is explained by an application of causal inference.

## Medical Trials

Suppose we are comparing two treatments for a disease. Suppose the disease has two severity levels, and everyone who catches it either dies or is cured. In other words, suppose we have an observed distribution over three binary variables. The following are some imaginary data: 

| | **Treatment 1** | **Treatment 2**
|**Low risk**| a | b
|**High Risk**| c | d
|**Total** |
