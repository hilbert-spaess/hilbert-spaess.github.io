Some things I'm confused about / that need resolving. This is in the context of my previous posts on causal inference: here and here.

## Efficiently and accurately extracting conditional independencies from noisy data.

## Why minimality is sensible (as opposed to some prior)

## Where do considerations of time come into causal inference?

## Continuous vs discrete variables

## Good/True intuitions (link) for the various conditions + criteria.

## Do we expect this causal diagram stuff to have any useful application?

## Where does carrying out experiments fit into Pearl's model of observational causal inference?
