Some things I'm confused about / that need resolving. This is in the context of my previous posts on causal inference: [here](https://hilbert-spaess.github.io/stats-Causality-from-correlation-Pearl's-approach/) and [here](https://hilbert-spaess.github.io/Simpsons's-Paradox-and-computing-causal-effect/).

## Extracting conditional independence sets from data.

**Confusion**: Pearl's approach centres on the ability to take samples from a distribution and determine conditional independencies. He assumes that we have access to the distribution itself, which renders the problem trivial. It reality, it doesn't seem that obvious.

## Why minimality is sensible (as opposed to some prior)

## Where do considerations of time come into causal inference?

## Continuous vs discrete variables

## Good/True intuitions (link) for the various conditions + criteria.

## Do we expect this causal diagram stuff to have any useful application?

## Where does carrying out experiments fit into Pearl's model of observational causal inference?
