## Causal definitions of incentives

A recent Deepmind [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07118.pdf) gives succinct definitions in the framework of causal graphical models for when an agent has an incentive to care about a variable. These definitions are phrased in the language of what the authors call "influence diagrams", which are causal structural models with some special **decision nodes** and **utility nodes**. A utility node is childless and has a value that represents the utility of an agent. A decision node is a node on which interventions are feasible (the agent has the power to carry out intervention on this variable). A **policy** is a specification of the function that determines the decision node given its parents.
