This is summary of the ideas I've found personally useful when attempting to run MCMC algorithms to sample from a distribution. The main use-cases I'm referring to are [survival curves](https://hilbert-spaess.github.io/STATS-survival-curves/) and inference on neural network models.

## Motivation and intuition

Assume we have a distribution over a high-dimensional vector of parameters $\theta$. We want to get some decent samples of $\theta

## ARS

## Dimension-jumping
