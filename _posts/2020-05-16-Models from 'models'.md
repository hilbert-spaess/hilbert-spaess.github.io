This is the first post in a projected multi-post sequence on *forcing* and its use in independence proofs in set theory. I'm hoping to take the sequence in a philosophical direction, but this is an area of philosophy for which quite a lot of (thankfully attractive) maths is needed. The intended pre-requisites are an understanding of first-order logic up to the completeness theorem. [Written by a beginner etc].

## What is a model?

A model is a structure with which we can interpret sentences in a formal language. In the first-order language of sets, an example of a *sentence* is $(\exists y)(\forall x)(x \not \in y)$. An example of a model of the language of sets might be $\{ \{1\}, \{1, 2\}}$.
