This is the first post in a projected multi-post sequence on *forcing* and its use in independence proofs in set theory. I'm hoping to take the sequence in a philosophical direction, but this is an area of philosophy for which quite a lot of (thankfully attractive) maths is needed. The intended pre-requisites are an understanding of first-order logic up to the completeness theorem. [Written by a beginner etc].

## What is a model?

A model is a structure with which we can interpret sentences in a formal language. Loosely, by interpretation we mean assigning a truth value to the sentence according to whether it holds in the model. In the familiar first-order language of sets, an example of a *sentence* $\phi$ is $(\exists y)(\forall x)(x \not \in y)$. An example of a model of the language of sets might be $M = \{\, \{1\}, \{1, 2\}}$, interpreting the formal $\in$ relation as standard set inclusion. With the usual first-order interpretation of $\phi$ in $M$, we assign a truth value of $1$.
