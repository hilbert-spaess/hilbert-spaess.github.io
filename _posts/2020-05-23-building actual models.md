When studying the model theory of set theory, ordinary models are what we really care about. The goal of the technique of forcing is the construction of new legitimate models of ZFC with interesting properties. How can we use $V^{\mathbb{B}}$ to build a new model of ZFC?

## The quotient $V^{\mathbb{B}}/U$

The idea behind quotienting: collapse the notion of fuzzy truth.

Why you want a filter. Why you want an ultrafilter.

Theorem: the quotient is a model of the language of set theory, and Los' theorem for the model.

If $U \in V$, doesn't do anything. So need something outside the model to make interesting. (Where it comes from is a question for later).

## The extension $V[G]$

Concrete equivalent to the quotient.
Quotient=definitely model, weird to understand.
Extension=conretely built, not obviously a model.

Generic: equal to the quotient. So now not only a model, but a concrete transitive model that extends $V$.

Generic model theorem.

## Quotient as extension

Alternative characterisation of generic filter

## What of genericity?
