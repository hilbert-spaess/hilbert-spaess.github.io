When studying the model theory of set theory, ordinary models are what we really care about. The goal of the technique of forcing is the construction of new legitimate models of ZFC with interesting properties. How can we use $V^{\mathbb{B}}$ to build a new model of ZFC?

## The quotient $V^{\mathbb{B}}/U$



## The extension $V[G]$

## Quotient as extension

## What of genericity?
