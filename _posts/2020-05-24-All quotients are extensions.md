We [previously](https://hilbert-spaess.github.io/2020/05/23/building-actual-models.html) saw that if $\mathbb{B}$ is a Boolean algebra, and $U$ is an ultrafilter, then $V^{\mathbb{B}}$ is a model of ZFC. Further, if $U$ is $V$-generic, then $V^{\mathbb{B}}/U$ is isomorphic to $V[U]$, the forcing extension of $V$ by $U$. As an aside to the main expository plotline, it's interesting to see how the isomorphism breaks down in the case that $U$ isn't generic, and what the appropriate generalisation is.

## $\breve{V}, \hat{V}$, and $\breve{V}_U$

## $V^{\mathbb{B}}/U$ thinks it's a forcing extension
