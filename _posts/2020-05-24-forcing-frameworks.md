This post will hopefully serve to clarify the big-picture view of forcing, before I finally plunge into some juicy independence proofs. To recap, we've defined the [standard Boolean-valued model](https://hilbert-spaess.github.io/2020/05/16/Boolean-valued-semantics.html), and seen how to use this to [construct new ordinary models](https://hilbert-spaess.github.io/2020/05/23/building-actual-models.html) by quotienting by an ultrafilter. Of these, the more important is the forcing extension $V[G]$, a transitive extension of $V$ with many desirable properties. The generic ultrafilter $G$ satisfies two roles: it is the new set we add to our base model, and it is also the crucial 'truth filter' when collapsing a Boolean-valued model. At this point, a nasty meta-mathematical question pops up: if $V$ is **the** set-theoretic universe, then where does a new set $G$ come from?

## $V^{\mathbb{B}}$ thinks it is a forcing extension

## Naturalistic conception of forcing
