## Platonists and formalists

A lot of conversations between people studying maths concern the set of natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$. I'll assume that anyone reading this has been part of such a conversation. And many of these conversations involve claims that could be formalised as a sentence in a first-order language like the language of PA, and concern the truth-value of these claims. I will say that someeone is **a Platonist with respect to the naturals** if they believe that every such sentence has a definite truth value when interpreted as referring to $\mathbb{N}$. Even if they don't know whether a sentence is true or false, they have the unshakable conviction that it must be one or the other, and they know this because they have access to a specific, true, model of the language of PA. By contrast, I'll say that someone is a **formalist w.r.t. the naturals** if they are only happy to talk about whether a sentence follows from a particular set of axioms, usually the standard axioms of arithmetic. This post is a summary of my opinions on whether it makes sense to be a Platonist w.r.t. $\mathbb{N}$, and more importantly, w.r.t. $\mathbb{R}$.   

I'm pretty confident that most working mathematicians are Platonists. This is based on three years of one-on-one interactions with PhD students and researchers in pure maths. I remember reading a quote to the effect that mathematicians are Platonists on weekdays, and formalists at the weekend. There is a day-to-day conviction that numbers exist, and that the work of number theorists lies in exposing the truths about these numbers. If under assault, most work could be reduced to deductions in some formal system, and all talk of $\mathbb{N}$ could be demoted to the role of an abbrevation for this formality, rather than literal truth. But no mathematician I've encountered so far has seriously doubted the existence of a specific object $\mathbb{N}$.

## The natural numbers

The first time I realised that there was even a question to be answered here was when studying the [incompleteness theorems](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoedelsFirstIncompletenessTheorem.html). In particular, the first theorem states that any formal system strong enough to contain PA must contain an undecidable sentence. This can be (and often is) more provocatively phrased to say that there exists a true, unprovable statement. I was confused about the meaning of "true" in this sentence, so I asked a lecturer. The straightforward response was that a statement about numbers was "true" if it held in $\mathbb{N}$. This, apparently, was a lecturer who was a Platonist on Sundays too- for once, this reference to $\mathbb{N}$ couldn't be rolled back to innocent formalism, but was admission of direct access to the true natural numbers.
