Going to try for a month of intense productivity, wrapping up some loose ends from the last three years. This feels like a transition period. Leaving Cambridge was sad. I'm not sure if plunging into work is a good idea, but I guess I'll know for sure in about a month from now. 

still a bit alienated from the words i'm writing. feels related to an inability to sense what's alive: long periods of static followed by bursts of painful overload. it's unlikely that i'm going to fix this stuff while forcing myself to work. i feel full of energy.

'loose ends':
1. three years of undergrad maths. would be nice to gather my knowledge and intuitions. 2. scattered ideas about statistics. want them bundled and disciplined: particular ideas about particular problems 3. set theory and forcing, which are the bits of maths that have felt most alive for me. 4. scamming a large company out of Â£3000/month by "working remotely" (~1% chance someone important sees this?? probably okay)
