Incubation period of Covid-19
    **Loose question**: how long between infection and symptom onset?
        Interest: useful quantity when modelling the spread of the virus.
    **Precise question**: given an infection is symptomatic, what is the distribution of delay between infection and symptom onset?
    Model: this is a survival curve problem. Want to estimate the proportion of (eventually symptomatic cases) that are symptomless at time t after infection.
        [link to survival curve model discussion]
        The flexible gamma-mixture model I discuss above seems applicable: it looks like there are multiple channels by which symptoms appear, occurring with different probabilities in different patients.
    Carrying out the inference
        Gamma mixture model for the full survival curve. For this option we compute a full bells-and-whistles posterior over all survival curve parameters.
            Gibbs sampling, as described on the page.
            [Am yet to carry out this inference- hoping to run code soon]
        Direct distribution fit to incubation period times.
            Single gamma fit
            Single log-normal fit
            Single gamma/Weibull fit
