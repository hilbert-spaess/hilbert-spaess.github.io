I'm working on a sequence of posts about the technique of **forcing** in set theory and its use in consistency proofs. Hopefully the sequence will go in a philosophical direction, but this is an area of philosophy for which quite a lot of (thankfully attractive) maths is needed. I'm still a total beginner in this area, so the presentation is probably very naive.

Intended pre-requisites:
- First-order logic up to the completeness theorem
- Basic theory of ordinals
- Axioms of ZFC
- Basic model theory of ZFC (Von Neumann hierarchy)

[Boolean-valued semantics](https://hilbert-spaess.github.io/2020/05/16/Boolean-valued-semantics.html) is an introduction to Boolean-valued models of set theory. In particular, I explore how we can use Boolean-valued models of set theory to construct ordinary models.
