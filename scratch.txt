## An application of BVMs to propositional logic

Let's show that Boolean-valued models can be used to solve an interesting problem in propositional logic.

We start with the simpler language of propositional logic. This consists of a family of **primitive propositions** $P$, represented by symbols like $p,q,r$, which are the atomic formulae. The Boolean algebra $S$ of sentences consists arbitrary combinations of atomic formulae assembled with the usual logical connectives of $\land, \lor, \lnot$, and $\Rightarrow$. For the sake of simplicity, we note that limiting our connectives to $\Rightarrow$ and a 'False' symbol $\bot$ will be just as expressive. A standard model (or **valuation**) of propositional logic is a homomorphism of Boolean algebras between $S$ and the binary truth Boolean algebra \{True, False\}. Put simply, it assigns binary truth values to sentences while respecting the basic logical operations. It is easy to show that a valuation is uniquely determined by the values it assigns to primitive propositions. For example, if $v$ is a valuation such that $v(p) = 1$, $v(q) = 0$, then $v(p \Rightarrow q) = 0$. A general Boolean-valued model is a straightforward extension: a homomorphism between $S$ and an arbitrary Boolean algebra $B$.

The usual axiomatisation of propositional logic consists of the following three axiom schema, formed by substituting $p,q,r$ in what follows with all possible combinations of elements of $S$. (These axiom schema suffice for completeness of propositional logic).

$$ p \Rightarrow (q \Rightarrow p) $$  
$$ [ p \Rightarrow (q \Rightarrow r)] \Rightarrow [(p \Rightarrow q) \Rightarrow (p \Rightarrow r)] $$  
$$ (\lnot \lnot p) \Rightarrow p $$

We ask the following question: does there exist a theorem of propositional logic, consisting only of primitive propositions and the connective $\Rightarrow$, such that it cannot be proved using only the first two axiom schema?

If there does exist such a sentence $\phi$, we are being asked to prove an *independence statement*: we are being asked to show that $\phi$ is independent of the first two axiom schema. The usual model-based approach to proving independence is to use the soundness theorem. For any (standard) valuation of propositional logic, if the valuation assigns truth value 1 to a set of axioms, it assigns 1 to all provable consequences. Thus, if we can find a valuation in which all axioms of the first two schema take value 1, but $\phi$ takes value 0, we have shown that $\phi$ cannot be deduced from these axioms alone. The problem is that if $\phi$ is a theorem of propositional logic, it will take value 1 in *any* valuation, so this argument is doomed to fail.

However, general BVMs will come to our rescue. A version of soundness also holds for valuations taking values in an arbitrary Boolean algebra. If a sentence is a logical consequence of a set of axioms assigned truth value 1, then the sentence will be assigned truth value 1. So if we can exhibit a Boolean-valued model of the first two axiom schema, for which the value assigned to $\phi$ is not 1, we will have shown the desired independence. Let's consider the next simplest Boolean algebra after binary truth. This has four elements, with two new 'midway' truth values $a$ and $b$ satisfying $a = \lnot b$ (this Boolean algebra has the structure of the powerset of a two-element set). We will call a valuation taking values in this structure a 4-valuation. Note first that any 4-valuation models the first two axiom schema.

Let's now guess a theorem of propositional logic that might require the third axiom for a proof. We expect such a sentence to indirectly appeal to the law of the excluded middle- an informal proof will split into cases according to whether a given proposition is true or false. A candidate is:  

$$ p \Rightarrow ((p \Rightarrow p) \Rightarrow p)$$

Indeed, this holds for 'different reasons' for different (standard) valuations of $p$. It is thus a theorem of propositional logic, and by completeness is provable with the first three axiom schema.

## Quotienting out $V^B$

When studying the model theory of set theory, ordinary models are the primary objects of study. The goal of the technique of forcing is the construction of new legitimate models of ZFC with interesting properties. How can we use $V^B$ to build a new ordinary model of ZFC?

If we want to get **objects** from **names**, we might want to try quotienting $V^B$ according to the Boolean-valued equality and containment predicates. One idea is to define equivalence classes by:

$$ [x] (=) [y] \Leftrightarrow \| x = y \| = 1 $$  
$$ [x] (\in) [y] \Leftrightarrow \| x \in y \| = 1 $$

We define $$V^B/\{1\} = \{[x] : x \in V_B \}$$. It's easily checked that the containment predicate on equivalence classes co-operates with the equality predicate, so $$(V^B/\{1\}, (=), (\in) )$$ is a fully-fledged model of the language of set theory. It remains to check that this is not only a model of ZFC, but is in fact a new model of ZFC.
