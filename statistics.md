use
I use the word **statistics** to refer to the use of mathematical models to achieve a goal. The main problem in the field is finding good models. A good model is one that you believe will help you achieve your goal. The problem of goal selection is often overlooked: a good goal is **genuine** (the modeller earnestly desires to achieve it) and **non-circular** (doesn't refer to the process of modelling itself). My favourite examples of good goals are prediction, compression and happiness. My favourite example of a bad goal is finding an accurate-looking model.
